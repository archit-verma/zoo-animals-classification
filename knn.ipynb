In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. Deep learning libraries such as keras and pytorch are also allowed.  You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n\n\n<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n\nYou will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it. We reserve the right to deduct up to 2 marks for unreadable or exessively inefficient code.\n\n<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via Canvas. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced on the discussion board (Piazza -> Assignment_1); we recommend you check it regularly.\n\n<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. Please check the <a href=\"https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/105477/modules\">CIS Academic Honesty training</a> for more information. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"p07JVvoScY4g"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Overview","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"wseHhYGScY4g"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this assignment, you will implement the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm and apply it to a real-world machine learning data set.

Each instance corresponds to an animal which has a unique identifier (the name of the animal; first field) and is characterized with 16 features:\n\n```\n   1. hair\t\t    Boolean\n   2. feathers\t\tBoolean\n   3. eggs\t\t    Boolean\n   4. milk\t\t    Boolean\n   5. airborne\t\tBoolean\n   6. aquatic\t\tBoolean\n   7. predator\t\tBoolean\n   8. toothed\t\tBoolean\n   9. backbone\t\tBoolean\n  10. breathes\t\tBoolean\n  11. venomous\t\tBoolean\n  12. fins\t\t    Boolean\n  13. legs\t\t    Numeric (set of values: {0,2,4,5,6,8})\n  14. tail\t\t    Boolean\n  15. domestic\t\tBoolean\n  16. catsize\t\tBoolean\n```\n\nYou need to first obtain this dataset, which is on Canvas (assignment 1). The files we will be using are called *zoo.data* and *zoo.labels*. Make sure the files are saved in the same folder as this notebook.\n\nBoth files are in comma-separated value format.\n\n*zoo.features* contains 101 instances, one line per instance. The first field is the unique instance identifier (name of animals). The following fields contain the 16 features, as described above.\n\n*zoo.labels* contains the gold labels (i.e., one of the seven classes above), for one instance per line. Again, the first field is the instance identifier, and the second field the instance label.\n\n**Task**: Read the two files  \n1. create a **training_feature** set (list of features for the first 90 instances in the zoo.* files) and a **training_label** set (list of labels for the corresponding). \n2. create a **test_feature** set (list of features of the remaining instances in the zoo.* files) and a **test_label** set (list of labels for the corresponding). \n\n**Check**: Use the assertion statements in *\"For your testing\"* to validate your code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = open(\"zoo.features\", 'r').readlines()\ngold = open(\"zoo.labels\", 'r').readlines()\n\ntrain_features = []\ntrain_labels   = []\ntest_features = []\ntest_labels   = []\n\n###########################\n## YOUR CODE BEGINS HERE\n###########################\n\nfor i in range(90):\n    train_features.append((data[i].strip()).split(\",\")[1:])\n    train_features[i] = list(map(int, train_features[i]))\n    train_labels.append(int((gold[i].strip()).split(\",\")[1]))\nfor i in range(90,101):\n    test_features.append((data[i].strip()).split(\",\")[1:])\n    test_features[i-90] = list(map(int, test_features[i-90]))\n    test_labels.append(int((gold[i].strip()).split(\",\")[1]))\n\nlegs = 12\n    \n\n###########################\n## YOUR CODE BEGINS HERE\n###########################\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>For your testing</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"assert len(train_features) == len(train_labels)\nassert len(train_features[0])==len(train_features[-1])\nassert train_features[2][12]==0 and train_labels[2]==4","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 2: Distance Functions (2.0 marks)\n\n<b>Instructions</b>: Implement the four distance functions specified below.
